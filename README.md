# cactpot-solve
Sets up a custom scratchcard which takes parameters:

rows = number of rows in scratchcard
columns = number of columns in scratchcard
number_to_scratch = number of spaces that can be scratched (revealed) before a line must be chosen
payout_dict = a dictionary containing the payout for each score

and determines which row has the highest expected payout.

The default settings simulate the Mini Cactpot from Final Fantasy XIV.
